## Overview

👩🏻‍💻 [Frontend Mentor](www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

⚡ This challenge was to build a single page Results Summary Component, with a button that has hover and focus states. There is also a data.json file for the option to use JavaScript to add the results and total score dynamically. I have not done this yet.

🚀 I built this with the help of [@KevinPowell](https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell)'s walkthrough video on his YouTube channel. It was especially helpful to learn more about the use of custom CSS properties, and to practice CSS Grid.
